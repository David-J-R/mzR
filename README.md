mzR
===

`mzR` is an R interface to common mass spectrometry data formats and
relies on third-party `C/C++` code, in particular
[proteowizard](http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/). It currently
supports random out-of-memory access to various raw data formats
(`mzData`, `netCDF`, `mzXML` and `mzML`) and identification data
(`mzIdenML`).

The package is available from the Bioconductor project as
[stable](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mzR.html)
and [devel](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/mzR.html)
versions. Please refer to the respective pages for installation
instruction and the package vignette for more details.
